# remote-mcp
Basic MCP Wrapper for the [remotemanager](https://gitlab.com/l_sim/remotemanager) package

Developed as part of the 2025 [LLM hackathon](https://llmhackathon.github.io/)

The team github can be found here: https://github.com/BigDFT-group/llm-hackathon-2025

This package is currently very experimental and should not be considered production-ready.

## Installation
Testing is currently done using `uv`. I imagine pip works also, however your mileage may vary.

Simply clone the repo and then `uv pip install -e .`

## Server
Run the MCP server with `uvx remoterun/remote.py`
